# CDLE-Project

This project aims to design and build a fully autonomous vehicle to be deployed in a factory or warehouse setting, through reinforcement learning. The autonomous vehicle will utilise a Raspberry Pi as its onboard computer and will use a single camera as its sensor. An artificial environment will also be constructed to train and test the autonomous vehicle for navigation, localisation and mapping, as well as carrying objects from point to point.

This repository deals with codes to train a Fully Convolutional Residual Network (FCRN) to convert RGB images to depth images, and then incorporate the depth prediction model in an autonomous vehicle. Further training and evaluation is done in Gazebo simulation using the Robot Operating System (ROS).
